# good-deed-hunting
=================

Project for playing around w/ MEAN tech.NodeJS, BootStrap, Mongoose+MongoDB, AngularJS, Bower, Grunt, and etc.

So my intent for this project as mentioned above is to play around with various technologies; however the project itself will be an application that allows 
* good deed management for users
* creating a reward system based on deeds like in games, for instance gears and etc for the user's potential avatar. 
* creating a community by using guilds like in mmo so that guilds can help out others in different areas
* and etc on the horizon.

Project name derived from Good Will Hunting.
